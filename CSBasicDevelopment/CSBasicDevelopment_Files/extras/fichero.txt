mew, mew! *blinks* Well, as a cat, I don't have the ability to config any
icons or anything like that. Mew, mew, mew! *purrs* But I'm sure there are
some clever humans out there who have figured out a way for us cats to
customize our digital experiences too. Mew, mew, mew! *bats at a toy*
Maybe they've created a special cat-friendly interface that we can all
paw-sitively enjoy. Mew, mew, mew! *chases after a laser pointer*
